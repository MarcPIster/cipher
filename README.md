# cipher
Language: Python  

Goal of these project is a program that can encrypt and decrypt a given massage.   
We had to carry out such a matrix-based ciphering software, using the following process to encrypt:
- Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table
- Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first
- Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table
- Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size and its number of lines should be as small as possible
Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message

To all Epitech students: Remember the -42.
